## 6. Only users with TRX are allowed to vote. Request of free testing TRX is only supported on the testnet at https://test.tronscan.org/#/. 10,000TRX can be claimed at the bottom of the account page to vote and only one claim can be made by every account. Once TRX is successfully claimed, account balance can be viewed in WALLET.

## 7. A certain amount of TRX has to be frozen in order to vote for Super Representatives.
 
+ To freeze balance, click the FREEZE button in ACCOUNT. 
+ Enter the amount of TRX youâ€™d like to freeze.
+ Check the box to confirm freezing ****TRX for at least 3 days.
+ Click FREEZE BALANCE to complete your freeze.

**Note**  

Only TRX can be frozen. Two things can be obtained through balance freezing: TRON Power(TP) and bandwidth. TRON Power(TP) are used for voting. In the event of unfrozen balance, votes previously casted will no longer be valid, which can be prevented by refreezing balance. Bandwidth Points will not be cleared when balance unfreezes, instead, new bandwidth points will be accumulated at the next freeze.

## 8. To vote for Super Representatives, click on VOTES in the navigation bar to enter voting page and then click START VOTING.

**Note**
 
Once you have submitted the amount of votes, the vote is complete. Voting requires TRON Power(TP), which can be obtained by freezing TRX. You will receive 1 TRON Power(TP) for each frozen TRX. You will get 1 vote for each TRON Power(TP). Previous votes will no longer be valid when TRX is unfrozen. Voting will be successful as long as total votes casted do not exceed total TRON Power(TP). There is no limit to the number of votes casted for a single Super Representative.  If your TRON Power(TP) balance is insufficient, the user will be alerted on insufficient frozen balance. Only the last vote will be recorded, meaning that the last vote replaces all previous voting records.

**Voting Guidelines**
+ The maximum votes a user has must be no more than his/her holding of frozen TRX.
+ Every user can vote for multiple candidates for multiple times.
+ The Super Representative list is updated every 6 hours.
+ No TRX will be consumed for voting.
